                explanation: "Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technology that is implemented within IPv4 networks. One application of NAT is to use private IP addresses inside a network and use NAT to share a few public IP addresses for many internal hosts. In this way it provides a solution to slow down the IPv4 address depletion. However, since NAT hides the actual IP addresses that are used by end devices, it may cause problems for some applications that require end-to-end connectivity."

NAT is working, as shown by the hits and misses count. Because there are four misses, a problem might be evident.

                explanation: "The output shows that there are two inside global addresses that are the same but that have different port numbers. The only time port numbers are displayed is when PAT is being used. The same output would be indicative of PAT that uses an address pool.

                explanation: "From the perspective of users behind NAT, inside global addresses are used by external users to reach internal hosts. Inside local addresses are the addresses assigned to internal hosts. Outside global addresses are the addresses of destinations on the external network.

                ],
                correctAnswers: [1, 4],
                explanation: "Static NAT is a one-to-one mapping between an inside local address and an inside global address. By using static NAT, external devices can initiate connections to internal devices by using the inside global addresses. The NAT devices will translate the inside global address to the inside local address of the target host."

                question: "What is the purpose of the overload keyword in the ip nat inside source list 1 pool NAT_POOL overload command?",
                choices: [
                    "It allows many inside hosts to share one or a few inside global addresses.",
                    "It allows a list of internal hosts to communicate with a specific group of external hosts.",
                    "It allows external hosts to initiate sessions with internal hosts.",
                    "It allows a pool of inside global addresses to be used by internal hosts."
                ],
                correctAnswers: [0],
                explanation: "Dynamic NAT uses a pool of inside global addresses that are assigned to outgoing sessions. If there are more internal hosts than public addresses in the pool, then an administrator can enable port address translation with the addition of the overload keyword. With port address translation, many internal hosts can share a single inside global address because the NAT device will track the individual sessions by Layer 4 port number."

Customers will access corporate web services via a public WAN that is implemented by a service provider, not by the enterprise itself. When employee numbers grow, the LAN has to expand as well. A WAN is not required unless the employees are in remote locations. LAN security is not related to the decision to implement a WAN."

A VPN gateway device could be a router or a firewall. A Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) is a standalone firewall device that combines firewall, VPN concentrator, and intrusion prevention functionality into one software image."
